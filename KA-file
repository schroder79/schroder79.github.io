        <p>Today was the first time I started posting on my adventure to becoming a computer programmer. It is something that I always wanted to try but never got the chance. I started learning about computers when I was in gradeschool, but only enjoyed them for creating games. Now I am becoming more and more involved and hope to become quite good. Here are some of my beginning projects. </p>
        
                <ul>
            <li>Cook book</li>
            <li>Article about dogs</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Here are some ideas that I would like to put into future posts.
        </p>   
            <ul>
                <li>Song lyrics</li>
                <li>Optometry related items</li>
                <li>first aid</li>
            </ul>

        <h6>I don't have a second post but I will sometime this year. </h6>
        
        <p>Hopefully I will learn to </p>
